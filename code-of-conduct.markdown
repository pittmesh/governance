[The PittMesh Working Group(http://www.metamesh.org/#!pittmesh/wjufq), also abbreviated as "PWG", is a friendly and welcoming organization. The PittMesh Working Group is an open, unincorporated community organization that encourages inclusion and participation from anyone willing to contribute time, energy, and/or resources. Members who have a passion for the PittMesh Community Wireless Network and its related subjects and projects should feel welcome contributing, regardless of their skill level or ability.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

The PittMesh Working Group is dedicated to proving a harassment-free environment for its employees, volunteers, contractors, customers, and users. All forms of harassment relating to, but not limited to: race, gender, sexuality, appearance, disability, education, skill level, life situation, etc., are forbidden and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

All members are required to treat each other with professional respect. The PittMesh Working Group does not tolerate any kind of disrespectful behavior including, but not limited to: direct or indirect verbal harassment, physical harassment, inappropriate gestures, intimidation, stalking, belittling, or any kind of behavior that may make a member feel unwelcome in the organization.

## Legality
 
Participants can make a reasonable assumption that any equipment recommended or provided by The PittMesh Working Group will conform to all federal, state, and local laws regarding wireless radio frequency. Unfortunately, laws change from time to time. If a PittMesh Working Group participant discovers their equipment is violating any of the above laws, they are **REQUIRED** to bring their equipment into compliance. Failure to do so will result in removal from the PittMesh Working Group Mailing list and dissasociation between the PWG and the individual.

If a piece of member equipment is defaced, stolen, or tampered with, please notify a member of The PittMesh Working Group leadership immediately so the situaion can be rectified.

## Future 

The PittMesh Working Group's leadership reserves the right to modify this document at any time at its discretion and without notice.
