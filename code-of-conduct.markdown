# Code of Conduct

*Document Last Updated: Jan 26, 2014*

[Meta Mesh, LLC](http://www.metamesh.org), known simply as Meta Mesh, is a friendly and welcoming organization. Meta Mesh is an open organization that encourages inclusion and participation from anyone willing to contribute time, energy, and/or resources. Members who have a passion for Meta Mesh and its projects should feel welcome contributing, regardless of their skill level or ability.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

Meta Mesh is dedicated to proving a harassment-free environment for its employees, volunteers, contractors, customers, and users. All forms of harassment relating to, but not limited to: race, gender, sexuality, appearance, disability, education, skill level, life situation, etc., are forbidden and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

All members are required to treat each other with professional respect. Meta Mesh does not tolerate any kind of disrespectful behavior including, but not limited to: direct or indirect verbal harassment, physical harassment, inappropriate gestures, intimidation, stalking, belittling, or any kind of behavior that may make a member feel unwelcome in the organization.

## Respect for Hosts and Property

Meta Mesh may ask its members to install equipment in the home or business of an individual who has volunteered their space for a project. Members should treat this individual and their space with the utmost respect at all times. Remember that while installing or servicing equipment, Meta Mesh representatives are a guest in this individual's home or business.

## Safety

As part of regular operations of Meta Mesh, participants may be asked to perform equipment installations and/or upgrades at antenna sites. All members must follow any safety guidelines set forth by Meta Mesh leadership. All Meta Mesh participants are responsible for their own safety and the safety of others. If a task seems unsafe, participants are expected to speak up. Equipment can always be installed or upgraded at a later time. *YOU* are a more valuable resource than any equipment.

## Legality

As part of regular operations of Meta Mesh, participants may volunteer to set up wireless equipment at their homes or businesses. Before installing any equipment, Meta Mesh *MUST* receive **WRITTEN** permission from the property owner. Do not set up any equipment if doing so violates any municipal ordinance. When in doubt, ask Meta Mesh leadership.
 
Participants can make a reasonable assumption that any equipment recommended or provided by Meta Mesh will conform to all federal, state, and local laws regarding wireless radio frequency. Unfortunately, laws change from time to time. If a Meta Mesh participant discovers their equipment is violating any of the above laws, they are **REQUIRED** to notify a member of Meta Mesh leadership and take the equipment offline as soon as possible, while still adhering to safety guidelines.

If a piece of Meta Mesh equipment is defaced, stolen, or tampered with, please notify a member of Meta Mesh leadership immediately so we can perform any asset tracking or run any required diagnostics.

## Future 

Meta Mesh reserves the right to modify this document at any time at its discretion and without notice.
