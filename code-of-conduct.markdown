# Code of Conduct

*Document Last Updated: Jan 25, 2014*

[Meta Mesh, LLC](http://www.metamesh.org), known simply as Meta Mesh, is a friendly and welcoming organization. Meta Mesh is an open organization that encourages inclusion and participation from anyone willing to contribute time, energy, and/or resources. Members who have a passion for Meta Mesh and its projects should feel welcome contributing regardless of skill level or ability.

## Mutual Respect

Meta Mesh requires its members to treat each other with professional respect at all times and expects everyone involved, e.g. employees, volunteers, and users, to abide by this code of conduct and our [anti-harassment policy](anti-harassment).

Meta Mesh may ask it's members to install equipment in the home or business of an individual who has volunteered their space for a project. Members should treat this individual and their space with the utmost respect at all times.

## Safety

As part of regular operations of Meta Mesh participants may be asked to perform equipment installations and/or upgrades at antenna sites. All members must follow any safety guidelines set forth by Meta Mesh leadership. All Meta Mesh participants are responsible for their own safety and the safety of others. If a task seems unsafe participants are expected to speak up. Equipment can always be installed/upgraded at a later time. *YOU* are a more valuable resource than any equipment.

## Legality

As part of regular operations of Meta Mesh participants may volunteer to setup wireless equipment at their homes or businesses. Before installing any equipment Meta Mesh members *MUST* receive **WRITTEN** or **VERBAL** permission from the property owner. Do not setup any equipment if doing so violates any neighborhood ordnance or could negatively impact your neighbors. When in doubt ask Meta Mesh leadership.
 
Participants can make a reasonable assumption that any equipment recommended or provided by Meta Mesh will conform to all federal, state, and local laws regarding wireless/radio frequency. Unfortunately laws change from time to time. If a Meta Mesh participant discovers their equipment is violating any of the above laws they are **REQUIRED** to notify a member of  Meta Mesh leadership and take the equipment offline as soon as possible (while still adhering safety guidelines).

If a piece of Meta Mesh equipment is defaced, stolen, or tampered with please notify a member of Meta Mesh leadership immediately so we can perform any asset tracking or run any required diagnostics.

## Future 

Meta Mesh reserves the right to modify/update items at it's discretion.
