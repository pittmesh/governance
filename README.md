# Meta Mesh Governance Documents

We, [Meta Mesh](http://www.metamesh.org), publish some of our governing documents for public comment, especially when those documents describe how we interact with the public.

Found an ideological problem or unclear phrasing? It's probably best to file an issue for further discussion.
